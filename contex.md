# DivanPapers - Context File

## Overview
DivanPapers is a **modern, scalable, and user-friendly** paper-sharing platform designed for students and educators. The platform allows users to upload, search, and download academic papers with ease, ensuring a structured and error-free experience.

## Hosting & Tech Stack
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages (Static Hosting)
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication (Google, Email/Password, OTP Login)
- **Database**: NoSQL structure for paper metadata
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with modern UI/UX principles)
- **Storage**: GitHub repository (for static files), Firebase Storage (if needed for PDFs)

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Project Setup
1. Create a **GitHub repository** for version control.
2. Set up **GitHub Pages** for static site hosting.
3. Initialize the project with an `index.html` file and a `README.md`.

### Step 2: Authentication Setup
1. Enable **Firebase Authentication** in Firebase Console.
2. Configure **Google Sign-In, Email/Password Authentication, and OTP Login**.
3. Integrate Firebase Authentication with the frontend using `firebase.js`.

### Step 3: Directory Structure Setup
Organize files properly to maintain a clean project structure:
```
